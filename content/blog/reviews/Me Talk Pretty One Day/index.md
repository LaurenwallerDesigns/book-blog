## Book Description
He sheds light on the little details of everyday life, highlighting strange encounters he has had in several different contexts. Accordingly, there are too many small interactions laid out in the book to mention here. Whatâ€™s important to grasp, though, is that Sedaris is interested in exposing not only the absurdities that people overlook in daily life, but also the humor that can be found in even the most mundane situations.

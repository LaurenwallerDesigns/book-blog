## Book Description

Leigh Coulton has worked hard to build what looks like a normal life. She has a good job as a defense attorney, a daughter doing well in school, and even her divorce is relatively civilized - her life is just as unremarkable as she'd always hoped it would be. But Leigh's ordinary life masks a childhood that was far from average... a childhood tarnished by secrets, broken by betrayal, and finally torn apart by a devastating act of violence.
